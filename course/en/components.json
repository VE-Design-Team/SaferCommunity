      "alt":"Reporting anonymously. When encouraged to report sexual harm to RMIT Safer Community, a victim survivor may reveal concerns about their privacy and express the wish to remain anonymous. If a student victim survivor wishes to remain anonymous, you can inform them that: if they are under 18 years of age, RMIT is legally obliged to make a report to the police. if they do not wish their identity to be shared, you can withhold their identity when discussing the matter with RMIT Safer Community. they will not be required, forced or obliged to be involved or participate in any formal process, such as investigations or disciplinary hearings. they may choose not to identify the alleged perpetrator when making a report. Victim survivors have the right to report incidents of sexual harm anonymously if they wish; however, you should be transparent about the limits of this confidentiality – if the identity of the student is needed to maintain safety you will be required to provide their details. ‘In some circumstances I might need to share your identity with RMIT Safer Community because of safety concerns. I will make sure I tell you if I do need to provide your name.”"
